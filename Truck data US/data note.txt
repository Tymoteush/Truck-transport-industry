a Other light includes all trucks under 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight excluding any listed Pickups, Vans and Sport utilities.																
b Other medium/heavy includes all trucks over 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight excluding any listed Farm trucks and Truck tactors.																
																
NOTES																
Sums may not equal to total due to rounding.																
Data for Farm trucks is no longer being collected as of 2013.																
Data for Pickups, Vans, Sport utilities, and Other Light Trucks are for vehicles 10,000 pounds or less gross vehicle weight.

Total operating revenues

Notes:

KEY:  N = data do not exist; R = revised;  U = data are not available.																											
																											
a Data from 1990 through 1997 include local trucking (4212), trucking, except local (4213), local trucking, without storage (4214), and courier services, except air (4215) based on SIC (Standard Industrial Classification). For 1998 and later, data includes truck transportation (484) and couriers and messengers (492) based on NAICS (North American Industry Classification System). Therefore, data from 1998 onward are not directly comparable with data prior to 1998.																											
b Sources of revenue applied to operating expenses. Prior to 1984 excludes commuter rail, automated guideway, urban boat, demand responsive, and most rural and smaller systems. Includes operating assistance.																											
c Amtrak began operations in 1971.																											
d Includes foreign traffic moving on domestic Coastal and Great Lakes and inland waterways.																											
e Oil pipeline revenues are much smaller than gas pipeline revenues because oil pipeline companies are common carriers that include transportation costs only.																											
f Data are not directly comparable from year to year due to acquisition and mergers. Prior to 1975, pipeline companies are not categorized by distribution, integrated, or combination. Total numbers for these companies are 1960 = 5,505; 1965 = 7,437; 1970 = 10,542. In 1997, the American Gas Association revised the database that identifies companies by type (distribution, integrated, or transmission). This reclassification of companies has resulted in numerous additions to the distribution company sample, in particular from the integrated company sample.																											
																											
NOTES																											
Eno Transportation Foundation has revised their methodologies for calculating water transportation and oil pipeline data series starting in 1990.																											
Class I rail data for 2017 include the impact of tax reform.

Average Freight Revenue Per Ton-mile

Note:

KEY: N = data does not exist; R = revised; U = data are not available.																										
																										
a For 1990 and later, air carriers that did not report both financial data and all months of traffic data for a given period were excluded from the calculations. Cargo revenue includes both scheduled and charter property revenue and mail revenue.																										
b General freight common carriers, most of which are LTL (less-than-truckload) carriers.																										
c Total finished goods. Converted to 1990 base year index by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and therefore not comparable to previous editions of this table.																										
																										
NOTE																										
There is a break in the data from 1985 to 1990 for Truck, Barge, and Oil pipeline; therefore, data prior to 1990 cannot be indexed using 1990 as the base year because the data are incomparable.
